FilterTest
==========

This is a simple program that is used to plot an audio waveform, along with its real fourier transform, and total fourier transform. Inspiration for this code came from Scott Harden's FFT code (http://www.swharden.com/). The hope is to use this code 

To-Do List
==========
  1. Add in colorblocks for certain frequency ranges
  2. Smoothen the data so less points have to be rendered. Maybe this makes everything run smoother?
  3. Implement PyFFTW

Current Problems
================
  1. Refresh rate for the graph is RIDICULOUSLY slow (Bearing on useable)
  2. Has to be force quit to be stopped
